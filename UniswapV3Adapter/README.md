# UniswapV3Adapter Module

## Overview

UniswapV3Adapter server as a common interface for external contracts to perform queries and swaps for Uniswap V3 Factories.
DexAggregator can use adapter to find the best offer between two assets for a given amount and execute this offer. It also accounts for query & swap gas-cost of the offer and for that needs gasEstimate from the adapter.

## How to Use
1. Deploy smart contract via `Bunzz`. When deploying, users can specify name, factory and static quoter address, swapGasEstimate and quoterGasEstimate.
2. Users can call `query` function to perform queries (find the best offer) betwen two assets for a given amount.
3. Users can also call `swap` function to perform swaps between two assets for a given amount.

## Functions

### `query`

Find the path from `tokenIn` to `tokenOut` with `amountIn`.

| amountIn    |uint256           | Amount of tokens being sold   |
| tokenIn     |address           | ERC20 token being sold        |
| tokenOut    |address           | ERC20 token being bought      |

### `swap`

Executes trades from `tokenIn` to `tokenOut` with `amountIn` and `amountOut`.

| amountIn    |uint256           | Amount of tokens being sold   |
| amountOut   |uint256           | Amount of tokens being bought |
| tokenIn     |address           | ERC20 token being sold        |
| tokenOut    |address           | ERC20 token being bought      |
| to          |address           | Receiver address              |

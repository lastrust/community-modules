# Bunzz Flash Loans (ERC3156) Module

## Overview

Flash loans allow smart contracts to lend an amount of tokens without a requirement for collateral, with the condition that they must be returned within the same transaction.

Early adopters of the flash loan pattern have produced different interfaces and different use patterns. The diversification is expected to intensify, and with it the technical debt required to integrate with diverse flash lending patterns.

Some of the high level differences in the approaches across the protocols include:

- Repayment approaches at the end of the transaction, where some pull the principal plus the fee from the loan receiver, and others where the loan receiver needs to manually return the principal and the fee to the lender.
- Some lenders offer the ability to repay the loan using a token that is different to what was originally borrowed, which can reduce the overall complexity of the flash transaction and gas fees.
- Some lenders offer a single entry point into the protocol regardless of whether youâ€™re buying, selling, depositing or chaining them together as a flash loan, whereas other protocols offer discrete entry points.
- Some lenders allow to flash mint any amount of their native token without charging a fee, effectively allowing flash loans bounded by computational constraints instead of asset ownership constraints.

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is overridden; NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.*

| _0 | uint8 | undefined |

### decreaseAllowance
